# Lab environment
We use Virtual Machines (VMs) or all the labs. All VMs are tested for [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

## Install VirtualBox 

VirtualBox can be installed on a personal computer like Windows. It is a challenge to install VirtualBox on new Apple computers. Therefore, we use Windows as the example to show how the installation can be done. VirtualBox can be used on Linux too.

Here are the steps to start (Click the links embedded in the blue and unlined text to watch videos):
1. Install VirtualBox on [Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mns5yqMfZk).
2. Download the .ova ((Open Virtual Appliance) file
   - Customized [Kali](https://www.cs.uml.edu/~xinwenfu/Tools/Kali-40G-2025.ova)
   - Windows: Please ask the instructor
3. [Import the .ova file](https://youtu.be/us5N0X75v-o) into VirtualBox. Basically double click the .ova file in Windows File Explorer and follow the on-screen instruction.
4. If a student feels the VM is slow, please watch How to [Speed up your VMs in VirtualBox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z7icd0vm0M) for Windows.

Try the following four networking options on these two VMs [3]: 
1.	Network Address Translation (NAT)
2.	NAT Network
3.	Bridged Adapter
4.	Internal Network
5.	Host-only Adaptor
