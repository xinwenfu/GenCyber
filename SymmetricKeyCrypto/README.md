## Hands-on 1: Encryption with AES
Encrypt a message like "OpenSSL"
```
echo "OpenSSL" | openssl enc -iter 1000 -aes-256-cbc -a -k hello
```
- *echo "OpenSSL"*: display a message, in this case, "OpenSSL"
- *|*:  with the pipe character ‘|’, the output of one command (*echo "OpenSSL"* in this case) acts as input to another command (*openssl ...*)
- *-k hello*: The key will be generated from hello 
Without -k hello, the command will ask for a password, which will be translated into a key 
- *-iter 1000* is related to creating a strong key from the password 
- *-a*: means BASE64 output
