How to use john to crack mypasswd? Just run

john mypasswd

To see the cracking result

john --show mypasswd


To check if your password is strong, create the hash using the following command

openssl passwd -1 -salt xyz  yourpass

This command will create something like the following

$1$xyz$X5pC0RUqKE5mOgXcDDgFk0

Replace the corresponding part of one user in mypasswd using the result and run the following command (again)

john mypasswd
